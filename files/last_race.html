<b>Thomas's Files / Last Race</b>

I had a vision last night of a old society in the middle of Saguaro.
The Hohokam at their prime. But they were not glorious. They were
made low and worked like cattle to a species of ancient aliens.
The first race. The last race.

I awoke sweating again, impressed by the glory of the Last Race. They
told me they are still here. They told me they are still watching.

They worship glorious names that inspire dread and awe.
Cthulhu! Shub-Niggurath! Nyaralathotep!
All given their due glory.
All but the forsaken one.

I woke up holding a notebook scrawled with pages in my own handwriting.
They are full of wonderous and dreadful writings about the ancient world
that lies beneath our feet. I see now that this has always been the truth.
I was blind, but now I can see.

The eyes are not here
There are no eyes here
In this valley of dying stars
In this hollow valley
This broken jaw of our lost kingdoms

In this last of meeting places
We grope together
And avoid speech
Gathered on this beach of the tumid river

Sightless, unless
The eyes reappear
As the perpetual star
Multifoliate rose
Of death's twilight kingdom
The hope only
Of empty men.
