A Park Ranger reports that sand blown by the previous week's storm have revealed a stone foundation. 
Preliminary inspections of the site confirm it is ancient. We will begin digging here as soon as possible.

Cultural artifacts within the Hohokam Saguaro Site have been carbon dated to 1400AD, shortly before 
the civilization disappeared. Among the recovered items were pottery, a figurine, and agricultural equipment.

Melody from the Geology department expressed interest in the chasm at the center of the Hohokam Saguaro Site.
The rock samples they analyzed had strange properties.

Now the Biology department wants in on it. Apparently the worms inside the chasm are nearly identical to ones
found in New Zealand. This interest in the Hohokam Saguaro Site has been inspirational for my paper, but Mel
isn't going to be listed as a co-author. She can put out her own paper.

I've been bad about updating these logs. I've been pre-occupied. The Hohokam Theory has consumed my time and
energy. Worms from New Zealand? From another blue cave? Culutral legends are an exodus underground? I spent
hours yesterday looking at the Petroglyphs. They paint such a story.
